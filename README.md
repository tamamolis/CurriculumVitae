4. My biography -->

<p>Mathematics and programming (computer) science were always a kind of challenge for me. They were not only exciting and complicated subjects to learn, but also a field that is used to be seen as non-female activity. When I entered Department of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics in [Voronezh State University (VSU)](https://www.vsu.ru/english/) there were only 3 girls in a group of 20 students. And this situation can be easily extrapolated to any other field of technical or natural sciences (all over Russia at least). So I have always had some extra motivation to succeed in it.</p>
<p>I have been interested in computer vision since I joined VSU. Unfortunately, there were no such courses there, but still I got a good base in applied mathematics and computer science. For example, the main focus in our department was on algorithms, data structures and studying different programming languages. As I already mentioned, I could hardly find a good specialist in computer vision at VSU, but I was enthusiastic enough to start a bachelor diploma project on this topic. It was dedicated to recognising images of automobile number plates.</p>
<p>After finishing my bachelor studies, I decided to enter the Department of Control and Applied Mathematics at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/english/). MIPT is considered one of the best Russian universities in IT, so I hoped to meet there a lot of highly motivated students, as well as many IT professional from both academic science and business. There I found the Chair of Control Systems, which were placed in State Research Institute of Aviation Systems</p>
<p>(GosNIIAS), and joined the Laboratory of Photogrammetry, which had a project in semantic segmentation of satellite images. This project aimed at automated map development. I had to perform a full development cycle from image marking procedure to post-processing. We tried to use a number of neural networks with different types of architecture to find the most efficient one. However, it was the preprocessing of images, that had the essential role in semantic segmentation. After we realised that, we started to experiment with data augmentation and post-processing. All our experiments results with data pre-processing, neural networks and data post-processing can be found in a paper [«Semantic segmentation of satellite images of airports using convolutional neural networks»](https://github.com/tamamolis/VGGUnet/blob/master/res/semantic_segmentation.pdf), that was published in September, 2020 in «Computer Optics» journal (in Russian, but images are speak for themselves).</p>
<p>As I was growing as a specialist, I felt that I am interested in applying my skills in a certain socially useful projects, for example, at the field of urbanism. The idea of using mathematical modelling and artificial intelligence for city planning seemed very exciting for me. That is why I decided to join [Dr. Alexander Gasnikov’s](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?hl=ru&user=AmeE8qkAAAAJ) group at MIPT for my PhD-studies. My current research here is in the field of math optimization, especially transport flows modelling. Currently I have been working on the problem of traffic flows equilibrium in Beckmann and stable dynamic models. I have already taken part in writing two papers on this topic (unfortunately, both of them are in Russian). The first one, [«The recovery model for the calculation of correspondence matrix for Moscow»](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11604), is about a problem of restoring the correspondence matrix, I wrote it in the group with other students of dr. Gasnikov, and it was published in [«Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation»](http://crm-en.ics.org.ru/journal/article/2977/) journal in November, 2020. The problem of calculating the correspondence matrix was reduced to the task of entropy-linear programming and we described several numerical optimization methods for solving it: Sinkhorn method and Accelerated Sinkhorn method. The second one, [«Finding equilibrium in two-stage traffic assignment model»](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04516) describes a two-stage traffic assignment model and is not published yet, but accepted by journal. The theoretical part was developed by Dr. Gasnikov in his doctoral dissertation, however my contribution was in the code and many [numerical experiments](https://github.com/tamamolis/TransportNet/tree/master) for the whole project. In the future we are planning to continue our work on this project, for example, add more stages in the model and make experiments with the Russian cities in collaboration with [Prof. E.A. Nurminski](http://www.mathnet.ru/eng/person34069).</p>
<p>At the moment I am very interested in new vacancies. The ideal one should include various mathematical methods and approaches, computer vision and machine learning. Hope I have enough experience and knowledge to contribute to your business and research :)</p>
